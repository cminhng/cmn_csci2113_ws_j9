1. The design pattern is a template. It's not actual code you can import, just a blueprint on how to code (structure-wise, behavioral-wise, or creation-wise) for optimal OOP. 
2. 
```
public class Database {
   
    private static DConnection connection;

    private Database(int port) {
        connection = new DConnection(int port);
    }

    public static Database getInstance() {
        
        if (connection == null) {
            connection = new DConnection(0);
        }

        return connection;
    }
}

```
3. 
```
public class AnimalFactory {

  public static Item getAnimal(String animalType, String name, int weight){
      switch(animalType){
          case "mammal":
              return new Mammal(name, weight);
          case "bird":
              return new Bird(name, weight);
      }
    return null;
  }
}

```
4. 
```
public class mammalAdapter extends fish {
  private Mammal mammal;
  public mammalAdapter(Mammal mammal){
    this.mammal = mammal;
  }

  public static void feed(String food, int weight) {
    return mammal.feed(food, weight, "antibiotics");
  }
  public static void clean(String cleaningProduct) {
    return mammal.clean();
  }
}

```
5. The benefit of using the Bridge patter is that you avoid creating and having to keep track of too many classes, one for each possible combination of "flavors" - which ultimately is not maintainable, especially because it exponentially increases every time you add a new possible "flavor". You can also reuse code (avoid lots and lots of duplicate code) and maintain good OOP principles.
